# Meme Player HTML

This is Meme Player HTML! Your one stop for trolling teachers, friends, or trying to perfectly time sounds for any situation. (hope it isn't a bad one!) With just a click of a button, you can play sounds, stop sounds, diguise your tab (if a teachers camping on your school's security tool), and get a free pass to the front office!

# Features

- Layout: The layout is functional with buttons to play sounds and stop them.
- Functionality: The sounds are functional and play well. There is a very tiny delay in between clicking the button and the sound playing. We will attempt to fix it.

# Why is this better?

This soundboard is authentic and made by 2 people with many sounds. Once this turns into an actual website, we will make it so you can upload sounds, create soundboards, and make sure your teacher-trolling experience is better than ever!
